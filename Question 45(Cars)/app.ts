// Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function obj(manufacturer:string , model_name:string  , options:{[key : string]:any}){
    let car = {
        manufacturer,
        model_name,
        ...options,
    };
    return car;

}
console.log(obj ("BMW AG","Phantom", {company_name : "Rolls_Royce",company_owner : "waheed",}));
